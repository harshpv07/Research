The user was walking back from the library when they noticed a suspicious looking man walking around the commuter/resident lot beside John Smith.

He hesitated so I asked again, a little more frustrated. He claimed he was with the police doing his patrols. He wasn't wearing a uniform and there was no police car around. He was a tall Middle Eastern man, wearing navy blue clothes, and a dark hat. I didn't get to see his shoes. He also had blue latex gloves on, which is what really struck me as bizarre. Since he never answered my question, I pressed to get information out of him and asked “so why were you looking under my car if I have a valid parking pass?” He responded “I don't need your car, I have two cars, baby.” I continued to walk back to my dorm and yelled at him to stay away from my car and went inside.

The user is in a room with two roommates, John and Alex. The user believes that John and Alex have been smoking marijuana in their room, and the user is concerned about the possibility of them smoking in the room. The user does not believe that they need to speak with an officer unless it is absolutely necessary.


 
 User:  I am the girlfriend of John in room 304 in Building 12, and I am spending the night in the room. John and I have been in the room all day, and his roommate, Alex, came back into the room after going out with his girlfriend bringing with him a STRONG scent of weed (at 10am). As soon as they entered, the room was FILLED with the strong scent. They also went out earlier to smoke, (around 4pm) and had an out loud discussion about making plans to do so for the whole room to hear. They went to their friend “Brandon,” who I believe may be one of their dealers. There is no doubt in my mind that if one was to open the door to the room, someone could smell it immediately upon entering. 
 Dispatcher:  Do they have drugs in the room, or have they done drugs in the room? Are they there now? Do you wish to speak with an officer? 
 User:  They do not have drugs in the room, however they do speak about smoking in their car often. They have not done drugs in the room (that I have knowledge of). Yes, they are in the room now.

The user reported a sexual harassment incident that occurred at the intersection of [PERSON] and [PERSON] streets. The user described the perpetrator as a brown-skinned man with a dirty face and clothes, wearing a gray sweater and black jeans. The user reported that the perpetrator was holding a skateboard.


 
 User:  Hello I would like to report something to you guys to prevent this from happening to other people. Especially to other girls/women. I am a [GPE] student. When I got out of my class at around #:## I decided to go to target across the street while I waited for my next class to start. Since I had an hour before my next class started. I was at the light to cross to [PERSON]'s when I saw a man coming towards the light to cross as well. I didn't pay much attention to him since I thought he was just going to cross the street. I crossed the street and was making my way to target when I noticed he was still behind me, following me. I continued walking, this time a little faster. I was almost to the doors to target when I felt a hand grabbing my behind. All I did was freeze there in place. My mind couldn't really react because I never thought this could happen to me. When I turned around he was already running. There was a nice couple there that saw what had happened and went to me to ask if I was ok. But by now he had already gone on his skateboard making a run for it. I understand it wasn't rape. And no I wasn't dressed provocative. I had normal pants and a tshirt on. But he still sexually harrassed me. I wouldn't want that to happen to anyone else especially knowing that middle schoolers also pass by there all the time. All I remember about the guy is that he was brown skinned. He looked homeless. His face was dirty along with his clothes. He had a dark gray sweater. Some black jeans and holding his skateboard. 
 Dispatcher:  Thank you for letting us know. We will be on the look out at out campus. Please call the police if you feel you are in danger.
